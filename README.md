### Write-up on the approach taken for UI design* 
---
Figma is used for the UI Design of the app.A dark theme is used which is preferred most people.Colour combinations are chosen such that thay are soothing to the eye.There are multiple frames connented through various prototypes to show the different pages of the app.Plugins were used to display various icons such as the home icon,info icon and many more.
Each blog post looks like a card giving a real feel.There are two sections one is the trending articles and one based on the user interests.
We have also created the feature of "log in/sign up through google" similar to the one in most apps and websites.
A feature to share the blog post is present and there are options to like the post or even comment on it.
The basic app design is created which can be modified futher for better usage.
